# Breast Cancer Tumor Segmentation using U-Net

## Overview

This project is focused on tumor segmentation in breast cancer images using a U-Net model. The code provided involves data preparation, model development, training, and making predictions. The U-Net architecture is a popular choice for image segmentation tasks.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/breast-cancer-tumor-segmentation.git
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages specified at the beginning of the code.

## Data Preparation

- The code reads images and corresponding masks for benign, malignant, and normal cases.
- Images and masks are resized and normalized for model input.
- Train and validation data are split from the dataset.

## Model Development

- The code defines a U-Net model for image segmentation.
- The U-Net architecture consists of a contraction path followed by an expansive path.

## Training

- The model is trained using the training data.
- You can adjust the number of epochs, batch size, and other hyperparameters as needed.

## Evaluation

- Metrics such as Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Jaccard Index (JI), True Positives Ratio (TPR), False Positives Ratio (FPR), and Global Accuracy (ACC) are calculated for model evaluation.

## Making Predictions

- The model is used to make predictions on validation or test data.

## Sample Predictions

- The code includes examples of displaying both original images and predicted masks.

## Dataset Source

- The code assumes a specific dataset structure where images and masks are organized in folders (benign, malignant, normal).
- The dataset path needs to be specified in the code.
